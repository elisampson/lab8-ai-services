# R&D: AI Provider Tests

## OpenAI
Connected successfully with valid key.  
Error: "Insufficient quota" â€“ requires paid billing.  
Not usable for free lab testing.

## Google Gemini
Tried multiple endpoints (v1, v1beta, v1beta1) with MakerSuite key.  
Returned "model not found" errors.  
Likely due to newer API version or browser limits.

### Decision
Both APIs authenticated but failed for free use.
